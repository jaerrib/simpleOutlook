# simpleOutlook

This is a fork of the **simpleOutlook** theme created by Alex Makas, radicalmonday <at> lᴉɐɯƃ <dot> com, and published under a GPL-2.0+ license. It was submitted as an artwork proposal for Debian 10 ("Buster") but was not selected for inclusion in the final release.

The wallpapers themselves are rather nice so I've chosen to liberate them by removing the Debian logo and making them available in a distro agnostic form.
